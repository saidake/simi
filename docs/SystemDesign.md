### Examples
#### java.util.Calendar
![aejuc1.png](assets/SystemDesign/aejuc1.png)
```text
 * <p>
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, {@code Calendar} provides a
 * class method, {@code getInstance}, for getting a generally useful
 * object of this type. {@code Calendar}'s {@code getInstance} method
 * returns a {@code Calendar} object whose
 * calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
